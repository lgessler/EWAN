This is an experimental port of [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) into the browser. I am using a variety of beautiful tools, including [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/),  [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/). It is still under development, but take a look around :-)
