This is an experimental port of [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) into the browser. I am using a variety of beautiful tools, including [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/),  [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/). It is still under development, but take a look around :-)

# Roadmap

☐ Translate [EAF XSD](www.mpi.nl/tools/elan/EAFv3.0.xsd) into a Clojure [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)
☐ Implement most basic ELAN workflows
☐ Allow export and import of EAF
☐ Full ELAN functionality coverage
☐ Support remote syncing of projects (this also entails accounts and auth)
☐ Support live collaborative editing *à la* Google Docs
