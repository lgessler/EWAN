This will be an experimental port of a minimal feature-subset of [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) into the browser. I am using a variety of tools I'm excited about, including [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/),  [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).

# Roadmap

☑️ Translate [EAF XSD](http://www.mpi.nl/tools/elan/EAFv3.0.xsd) into a Clojure [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)

☐ Implement most basic ELAN workflows

☐ Allow export and import of EAF

☐ Full ELAN functionality coverage

☐ Support remote syncing of projects (this also entails accounts and auth)

☐ Support live collaborative editing *à la* Google Docs
